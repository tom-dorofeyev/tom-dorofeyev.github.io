Over the past year we’ve all witnessed the progress of generative AI. With it came a wave of predictions:  
_Software engineers are finished, jobs will vanish, product managers will take over, the end is near…_

But I kept asking myself: how exactly is it supposed to happen? Why are people so confident that AI will replace us?

## AI is a tool, not a replacement

After working with AI tools for a few months now, I’ve seen their power firsthand. They are powerful — they help us ship code faster and more reliably than ever (**when used correctly!**).

But here’s the thing: they’re still just tools. They don’t replace the thought process, the judgment, or the professionalism behind software engineering.

If your definition of being a programmer is _“just write code that works”_, then yes, AI will replace you.

## Coders vs. Engineers

After 6+ years in the industry, working in several companies, my experience may still be considered limited, but I've noticed something important. There are mainly two types of developers:

1. Those who churn out code to get features working quickly
2. Those who approach engineering as a profession

The first group? They were already replaceable — AI just made it obvious.

Now the second group? At this point it’s really difficult for me to see how generative AI is going to replace them.

## What Professionalism Looks Like?

So how do you stay in the second group?

### Know the business

- Understand why you’re building something.
- Learn how your work connects to the revenue. As engineers, our code isn’t the product the value it creates is. Your job is to help the company make money.
- Work on your negotiation skills:
  - _“I understand the client wants this but it will conflict with some of our current functionalities.”_
  - _“I can implement it in a week but it will not include features X, Y, Z…”_
- Ask the right questions before writing a single line of code.

### Know your craft

- Learn, understand, and practice the SOLID principles, these are time-tested guidelines for software and system design.
- Don’t cut corners on estimation. Think deeply before you commit. Breaking commitments to management causes a culture of distrust between management and development, and this is a slippery slope to a toxic culture.

### Keep improving

- Use AI tools and get familiar with them as soon as possible because they are here to stay.
- Invest an average of at least 2–3 hours a week into practice and learning new skills.
- Read books and articles to expose yourself to other professionals and learn from them.

# The Age of Professionalism

AI won’t eliminate true engineers — at least not any time soon.

What it will do is expose who’s been pretending.

**The future belongs to professionals.**
